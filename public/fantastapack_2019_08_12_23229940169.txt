11:56 AM | Visitor: Hello. I was wondering if it is possible to order different boxes for review for a subscription service I am about to start.

11:57 AM | Ryan from Fantastapack: That is possible with our site.  Do you know the dimensions of your subscription box?

11:57 AM | Visitor: No I want to purchase different sizes to see which size I like.

11:57 AM | Ryan from Fantastapack: Wouldn't the size depend upon the product size?

11:58 AM | Visitor: Well I plan to have different items. For example for the 1st month I will have a book, journal and maybe a water bottle etc.

12:00 PM | Ryan from Fantastapack: You could create multiple boxes and add each box to your shopping cart.   Below are the instructions to create a custom box on our website.  
 To get a quote for product, shipping rates or to continue on and place an order, simply follow these steps:

2. Once inside your box style page enter your box DIMENSIONS 
3. Choose your MATERIAL. 
4. Check the PRINT OPTION you require. If you need a PLAIN/BLANK BOX then select the 'No Print - Plain' option 
5. Enter your QTY: there is no minimum! 
6. Your custom pricing will be visible, and changing the QTY will change the price automatically as well 
7. Enter your production method.  You can choose our standard production option (10 days to create the custom box order) or our rush production option (7 days to create your custom box order). 
8. Click either the Design Online button (to access the online editor) or click the Add To Shopping Cart button (if you are planning to apply the artwork to the custom die line PDF using a tool like Adobe Illustrator). 
9. If you want shipping prices, just enter your state and zip in the shipping calculator field at the bottom of the shopping cart.
